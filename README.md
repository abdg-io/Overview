# A Better Day Groups Operating Manual for Transparency
Welcome! We were inspired by a few VCs where they provided an operating manual to provide people all the information you could possibly want to know about ABDG; and we will continually update it to fill in holes that are discovered.

This manual was inspired by a commitment to radical transparency which we learned from Starting Line Investments, who was inspired by Bloomberg Beta.

## What We Do 
A Better Day Groups is evolving the mental health ecosystem with a platform that fuses immediacy care with training, licensing, and certification to expand the workforce while providing communities with Urgent Mental Health Care.

The decline of mental health is accelerating, and there are not enough practitioners to service the problem or the broader healthcare system.

ABDG's comprehensive pipeline provides access to dedicated 24/7 on-demand services and peer-specialist groups. Beyond providing person-to-person support, we've developed a software platform that improves the quality of intake & assessment information to accurately assess a person's need and properly direct them to the right type of support. 


## Where We Need Support
We are looking for venture capital partners to anchor our seed round with check sizes ranging from $250,000 - $3,000,000. Our sweet spot would be investor(s) within that range to support, leading with $1-1.25M into a $3M seed round. 

We have built everything thus far, boot-strapped and throguh MOUs. 

With direct funding we'll be able to do 6 critical things over the next 12-months:
1. Key hires, 2-3 months, we have had preliminary conversations with 10 people (including founders) who consist of the GTM team.
2. Securing specialized TRMS insurance, 2 weeks, a contract has been negotiated, and funds will be used to activate.
3. Securing business insurance, 1 week, a contract has been negotiated, and funds will be used to activate.
4. Expanding customer base of certification and licensing pipeline; 6-12 months; while we currently have 9 Higher Education Institutions signed to MOUs that may convert to RR after time-based MVP service-run. The funds will be used to engage an additional 76 California schools with MFT/MSW programs that have been found to meet the LMFT/MSW/Peer-Specialization licensure requirements.
5. Scaling production of our software platform and tools; 6-12 months; funds will be used to establish backend dashboards and user interfaces, activate training programs at Higher Ed sites, and assess site-based roles with Health Care Providers to inform how to incorporate professionals differently.
6.Focusing on KPI-growth of intake & assessment tools; 6-12 months;  contract has been negotiated, and funds will be used to activate and scale current R&D.

## The Right Team
As the founders of a mental health platform, we are dedicated to the proposition that a small group of people can make an outsized impact and catalyze the systemic change necessary to build a better world. Positive mental health is a cornerstone to that end, generating a healthier environment of outcomes across diverse communities. Now weâ€™re ready to seize this moment by connecting with the right team that can help us create a movement to evolve an ecosystem.

We are a multidisciplinary team that either currently works in mental health care, conducts research in the problem areas, or works directly with peer-specialist populations. We know how to fill the gaps in the mental health workforce and how to facilitate unique partnerships using ready-built networks to give communities specific quality care that listens and speaks to everyone's lived experience.

## Getting in Touch
There is no right or wrong way to get in touch with us. A cold e-mail (nzoffel@abdg.io) or Twitter DM (niczoffel) to set-up a virtual or face-to-face conversation.

## How We Think
Despite the wide volume of new mental health apps and services, much has remained the same in how care is accessed or provided. Currently, most innovations to the mental health marketplace have come in the form of apps and services that make claims of 24/7 access and affordability. However, when you use the apps or services, it becomes clear that the market is recreating old models with a new veneer, and all share common features that triage not address the problem.

Our platform fuses immediacy care with training and certification to expand the workforce. Our approach is novel because we created a concurrent flow to evolve the mental health ecosystem. We do this with our comprehensive pipeline that grows the workforce, internalizes service & care, and expands affordable treatment.
